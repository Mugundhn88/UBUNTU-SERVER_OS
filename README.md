## Introduction

Ubuntu Server is a powerful, open-source operating system designed for servers. It offers stability, security, and a robust set of features that make it ideal for both small and large-scale applications. This repository aims to simplify the installation process and provide resources for users at all levels.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation, ensure that you have the following:

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Minimum 1 GHz CPU
   - 512 MB RAM (1 GB recommended)
   - 2.5 GB of free hard drive space

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - A bootable USB drive or DVD with the Ubuntu Server ISO image.
   - A reliable internet connection for downloading updates and packages.

3. **Knowledge Requirements**:
   - Basic understanding of command-line operations.
   - Familiarity with network configurations.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download Ubuntu Server

First, you need to download the latest version of Ubuntu Server. You can find the release files in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Mugundhn88/UBUNTU-SERVER_OS/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file for your architecture (e.g., amd64).

### Step 2: Create Bootable Media

Once you have the ISO file, create a bootable USB drive or DVD. You can use tools like Rufus (for Windows) or Etcher (for macOS and Linux) to accomplish this.

### Step 3: Boot from the Installation Media

Insert the bootable USB or DVD into your server and restart the machine. Access the BIOS/UEFI settings to change the boot order if necessary. Select the USB drive or DVD as the primary boot device.

### Step 4: Start the Installation

After booting from the installation media, you will see the Ubuntu Server installation menu. Select "Install Ubuntu Server" to begin.

### Step 5: Configure Language and Keyboard

Choose your preferred language and keyboard layout. This step ensures that the installation process matches your preferences.

### Step 6: Network Configuration

You will be prompted to configure your network settings. You can choose between DHCP (automatic) or manual settings. If you're using a static IP, enter the necessary details.

### Step 7: Configure Storage

You will need to select the disk where you want to install Ubuntu Server. You can choose to erase the entire disk or create custom partitions. If you're unsure, the guided option is a safe choice.

### Step 8: User Setup

Create a user account and set a strong password. This account will be your primary access point for managing the server.

### Step 9: Install Additional Software

You will have the option to install additional software during the installation process. You can choose to install OpenSSH server for remote access or any other packages that suit your needs.

### Step 10: Complete the Installation

Once all configurations are set, the installer will copy files and install the operating system. This process may take several minutes. After completion, you will be prompted to remove the installation media and reboot the server.

## Post-Installation Configuration

After the installation, follow these steps to configure your server:

### Update the System

Run the following command to ensure your system is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Configure Firewall

Ubuntu Server comes with `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall). You can enable it with the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

### Install Essential Packages

Consider installing essential packages for better functionality:

```bash
sudo apt install vim git curl
```

### Set Up SSH Access

If you installed OpenSSH during setup, you can connect remotely using an SSH client. Use the following command from another machine:

```bash
ssh username@your_server_ip
```

Replace `username` with your user account and `your_server_ip` with the server's IP address.

## Common Issues

### Issue: Boot Failure

If the server fails to boot from the installation media, check the following:

- Ensure the USB drive or DVD is correctly created.
- Verify that the BIOS/UEFI settings prioritize the boot media.

### Issue: Network Connectivity

If you experience network issues:

- Double-check your network settings during installation.
- Ensure the network cable is securely connected.

### Issue: Installation Hangs

If the installation hangs at any point:

- Try rebooting and starting the installation again.
- Check for any hardware issues.
